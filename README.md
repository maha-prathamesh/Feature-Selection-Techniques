# Feature-Selection-Techniques
<b>1) Filter Techniques</b> (Feature Size = 390) 
- Constant filter (Feature Size after constant filter = 295)
- Quasi constant filter (Feature Size after quasi constant filter = 270)
- Remove duplicate feature (Feature Size after removal of duplicate feature = 227)
- Correlation (Feature Size after removal of duplicate feature = 103)

##### Advatage
- Very fast
- Improves model efficiency

##### Disadvantage
- Not much improved accuracy
- No relation check between filter
