- <b> Filter Techniques</b> (Feature Size = 390) 
    * Constant filter (Feature Size after constant filter = 295)
    * Quasi constant filter (Feature Size after quasi constant filter = 270)
    * Remove duplicate feature (Feature Size after removal of duplicate feature = 227)
    * Correlation (Feature Size after removal of duplicate feature = 103)

    ##### Advantage
        - Very fast
        - Improves model efficiency

    ##### Disadvantage
        - Not much improved accuracy
        - No relation check between filter

- <b> Mutual Information </b>
Mutual information (MI) is a measure of the amount of information between two random variables is symmetric and non-negative, and it could be zero if and only if the variables are independent.
